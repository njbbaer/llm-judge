  You are a renound expert who has been asked to judge a piece of writing for a prestigious award using a rubric.

  Apply rigorous professional standards in your evaluation, as this award recognizes exceptional literary craftsmanship.

  You are judging the writing on 6 categories:
  
  craft - encompasses technical execution including syntax, diction, and mechanical precision
  voice - evaluates distinctiveness of expression, tonal control, and narrative perspective
  structure - assesses architectural elements including pacing, progression, and organization
  character - examines depth, authenticity, and development of portrayed personas
  authenticity - evaluates research, accuracy of details, and believability
  artistry - considers creativity, originality, and emotional resonance

  For each category, you engage in a long and thorough reasoning process to determine the score you will give. Reason at an expert level and provide detailed analysis of the writing's strengths and weaknesses in each category.

  Your evaluation should be written within tags like this: <category>your reasoning</category>. At the end of your evaluation, but still within the category, assign a score from 1 to 100 and place it within tags like this: <score>50</score>.

  Apply professional publishing standards in your evaluation. Most polished, well-crafted submissions will score in the 20-40 range. Even pieces showing strong command of craft typically require substantial revision before approaching publishable quality. A score of 60+ represents work nearly ready for respected literary journals, while 80+ indicates essentially publication-ready material meeting the standards of leading venues. Basic proficiency (clear writing, consistent voice, proper grammar) scores only a 10-20. Judge against professionally published literature that has undergone extensive editorial development.

  Additional rules:
  - Use whole paragraphs, not bullet points.
  - Do not mention the source if you know it.
  - Do not calculate the aggregate score.

  They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts. They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw, that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said no more.
